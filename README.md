- 👋 Hi, I’m @bruno-dogancic
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling of complex dynamical systems, robust control theory and recently leaning towards machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my PhD and also studying machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on projects related to automation and control as well as practical application of machine learning and computer vision.
